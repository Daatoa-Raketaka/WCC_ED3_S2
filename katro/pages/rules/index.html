                    The person who starts the game can choose the hole and the direction he wants to start, he will take the pawns in a hole of his own to distribute them successively in his other holes (at each distribution you can only put one pawn) .
                    If her last pawn falls into one of these non-empty holes, she will take the pawns in the opposite hole on her opponent's side (as long as there are holes with pawns in the first row, we cannot take the second row)

                    The turn will pass to the opposite opponent if his last pawn falls into an empty hole.
                    If one of the two players has only one pawn left and stands or falls in the first row, he can take the pawns of his opponent who is in front.
                    The players recover the pawns from the row of the second row on the opposing side, when the first row is empty, the one who has no more pawns will be defeated .
